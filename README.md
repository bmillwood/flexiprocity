# flexiprocity

[reciprocity.io](https://reciprocity.io) is a website where you can indicate
interest in people that they only find out about if it's reciprocated.

flexiprocity is inspired by reciprocity, with a different feature set and
entirely fresh implementation.

## things from Facebook ToS to ensure

- There's some restrictions on sharing platform data, but my guess is that
  sharing checkbox data (as may be necessary for a migration from one
  reciprocity to another) counts as its own thing, not as platform data.
- We must make reasonable efforts to keep Platform Data up to date, including
  modifications and deletions, and we must allow users to ask for their data to
  be modified or deleted.
- We have to delete platform data under a variety of circumstances; "whenever
  it's not needed, or whenever requested" should probably suffice.
- You need to report security incidents to them.
- They can audit you, and "You will cooperate with the Audits, including by (1)
  providing all necessary physical and remote access to your IT Systems and
  Records" (!), and "If an Audit reveals any non-compliance by you or your
  Service Provider(s) then you will reimburse us for all of our reasonable costs
  and expenses associated with conducting the Audit and any related follow-up
  Audits."


### irrelevant ToS commentary

- their licenses for your content seem kind of intense, and survive even when
  you stop using the platform
